  "summary": "The diff implements REQ-1 comprehensively. All eight sections (MissionPage, LatestProgress, EcosystemSpotlight, CybercrimeAwareness, InvestingWisdom, TrustedResources, XPosts, HomePageLinks) now accept an `isAdmin` prop and conditionally render Add/Edit/Delete controls only when authenticated. App.tsx uses `useInternetIdentity` to derive `isAdmin` and renders an Admin Login button for unauthenticated users and a Logout button for authenticated users. Content remains visible to all visitors regardless of auth state. All acceptance criteria appear satisfied.",
