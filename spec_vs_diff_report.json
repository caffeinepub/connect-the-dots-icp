  "summary": "All four requirements appear to be implemented in the diff. REQ-1 is addressed by updating backend/main.mo with a non-optional ExternalBlob image field in the Spotlight type and adding a migration module. REQ-2 is addressed by updating AddSpotlightDialog.tsx with a required photo upload at the top, validation error, and upload progress. REQ-3 is addressed by updating EditSpotlightDialog.tsx with current photo preview, replacement upload with progress, and fallback to existing image. REQ-4 is addressed by updating EcosystemSpotlight.tsx with full-width banner images before title/content and a styled placeholder for entries without a photo.",

      "description": "A backend migration module (backend/migration.mo) was added to handle schema migration from optional to non-optional image field.",
      "reason": "The build request does not explicitly mention creating a migration module; it only asks for the image field to be stored as a blob. This is an implementation detail not requested in any REQ.",
