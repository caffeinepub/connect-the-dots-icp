  "summary": "The diff shows comprehensive implementation of all four requirements for fixing the article upload functionality. Backend addArticle function was fixed to accept proper parameters and store articles correctly. Frontend mutation in useQueries.ts includes proper actor validation, error handling, and query invalidation. AddArticleDialog.tsx implements thorough actor readiness checks, detailed logging throughout the submission flow, and proper async handling with mutateAsync. All acceptance criteria appear to be addressed through the implementation.",
