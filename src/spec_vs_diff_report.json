  "summary": "The diff implements core data persistence infrastructure (migration.mo, data structures in main.mo) and CRUD operations for most content types required by REQ-1. However, the diff is heavily truncated, preventing full verification of REQ-2's UI/frontend requirements (Additional Resources tab, delete buttons, home page links with thumbnails). The project_state.json shows both requirements as 'pending', suggesting implementation may be incomplete.",

No frontend files are present to verify the Additional Resources tab navigation, delete button UI implementations, or home page links display with thumbnails. The main.mo file is truncated, preventing verification of all delete endpoints.",
