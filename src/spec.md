# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Redeploy the Connect the Dots application to production while preserving all existing backend data and Version 12 functionality.

**Planned changes:**
- Redeploy current application (Version 12) to production environment
- Ensure all existing backend data is preserved during deployment (articles, X posts, spotlights, wisdom entries, resources, cybercrime articles, home page links, mission content)
- Verify Additional Resources tab, delete buttons, and home page links with thumbnails remain functional after redeployment

**User-visible outcome:** The application will be live in production with all existing content intact and all Version 12 features (Additional Resources tab, delete buttons across content types, home page links with thumbnails) working as expected.
